1) Using random bytestring function in Handler monad
--> fixed by using liftIO function to lift from IO to Handler

2) Can't restrict timing when statically serving uploaded files
--> fixed by using a get request and a handler to manage download requests

3) using /var/yesod-uploads breaks the travis build
--> fixed: include sudo mkdir /var/yesod-upload and sudo chmod 0777 /var/yesod-upload in the travis yaml

4) dealing with type conversions between bytestring and string and text
--> always annoying but can use Data.Text.unpack, Import.unpack, something.toString to work with types

5) converting download window to user time zone on the download landing page for display
--> need to do this still i think

6) Retrieving time zones -- lots of type errors trying to call optionsPairs using the TZ label list package
--resolved - issues with Data.Map.map versus Data.lsit.map

7) time zone retrieval -- how do we pass a client javascript value to be used in haskell on the server
--> resolved by using a post request and new handler

8) possible bug for new time zone retrieval script -- writing to file is subject to concurrent user issues
--resolved -> we're doing something else
